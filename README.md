# Portchain Frontend Service

### Setting up and running the application locally

1. Clone the `portchain-be` and `portchain-fe` repositories.
2. Start the backend server by running `npm i` followed by `npm start` in the `portchain-be` project directory.
3. Launch the client application by running `npm i` followed by `npm start` in the `portchain-fe` project directory.
The backend server is set to run on port `8080` and the frontend client on port `3000`.

### Running tests - if I get some spare time tomorrow
